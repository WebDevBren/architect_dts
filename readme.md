# Wikitude ARchitect Typings for Typescript!

#### Releases :
Version 1 : Initial Release, Full Types as of version 6.1.0. EXCLUDING DEPRECATED FEATURES
#### TODO : 
Version 2  : Including all the wonderful comments.



## why? 
Got fed up of having no code completion, decided to fix it!

### Installation 

`npm install --save-dev architect_dts`

### Usage

``` 
    import { logger } from 'AR';

    logger.activateDebugMode();

```
It's as simple as that!


### Webpack

Remember to set AR as an External Package to avoid it attempting to compile it!
